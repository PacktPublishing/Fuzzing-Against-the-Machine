Before reading this document, you should first take a look at skins-howto.txt
to understand the general functioning of VLC skins.

What is an event ?
==================

Events are the dynamic part of the skins. It means that beyond visual aspect,
the interface must react with the user actions. An event describes a simple
interaction, in fact one simple action such as playing a file, hiding a
window...
So when designing a skin you will have to specify what those interactions are.
For this you will use simple actions that are described in event tags and you
would be able to add them and associate them to controls.

How to create an event ?
========================

An event describes a simple action as seen above.
All attributes are explained in the 'skins-howto.txt' file except the 'event'
attribute which is a bit special.
In the 'event' attribute you will enter a simple script with the following
syntax :
  "EVENT(parameter1,parameter2,...)"

The number of parameters depends on EVENT.
All this is case sensitive.
Don't add spaces.

What to do with events ?
=======================

When creating your event, you must assign an ID to each of them.
Now you have to associate events with controls.
Some attributes of some controls are supposed to be filled with those IDs. That
is to say that when the action corresponding to the attribute will be done,
the event associated will be executed. The best example is assigning an event
to the 'onclick' attribute of a button control. The event will be executed when
clicking on the button.
You can execute several events. To do this you just have to separate them with
semicolon.
Example:
  <ButtonControl [...] onclick="event1;event2;event3"/>


Do I have to create every event for each skin ?
===============================================

No, a set of predefined events are present. Here they are with their ID and
shortcut.
