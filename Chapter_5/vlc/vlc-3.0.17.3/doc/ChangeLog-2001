      * Fixed detection of the esd plugin.
      * Fixed the ts plugin's input type detection.
      * Fixed the BadCursor error in the x11 and xvideo plugins. For real this
        time (unlike my 2001/08/03 fix :p).
      * Made the wall filter work a bit better. It now spawns a 3x2 mosaic,
        but this will eventually be configurable, � la `--filter wall:3x3'.

    *Some fixes for dvdread plugin.
    
    It compiles but doesn't work yet.

commit cc0f0bb6fd28d5ed3463be4a227990cbae8a849f
Author: Sam Hocevar <sam@videolan.org>
Date:   Sun Dec 30 07:09:56 2001 +0000

    Some heavy changes today:
      * Removed duplicate function checks from configure.in.
      * Added extra magic to Makefile.modules so that the module Makefiles
        are now ridiculously simple. And I mean *simple*. Check it! This will
        make a possible switch to full autoconf/automake a lot easier.
      * Added the vlc version name to the plugin symbols, to be sure we only load
        plugins with the same version number. A nasty consequence is that you
        need to rebuild your tree after midnight if you are using a CVS tree :-)
      * Got rid of modules_export.h by #defining exported functions in the same
        header as their prototype.
      * Added modules_inner.h and other commonly used .h files to common.h so
        there are less and less files to include, and renamed common.h to
        <videolan/vlc.h>.
      * First modifications to the module handling system towards my ultimate
        goal to get rid of the *_Probe functions. Got rid of TestMethod and
        TestCPU, as well as src/misc/tests.c.
      * Wrote the chroma plugin handling functions. No YUV functions have been
        ported yet because it'ls a lot of work, but the core system works, I
        tried it with a naive yv12->rgb16 plugin (which will disappear when the
        real functions are ready).
      * Made a lot of functions in dvd_summary.c one-liners to avoid wasting
        too many output lines.
      * Fixed a segfault in input_dvd.c:DVDInit.
      * Added a fixfiles.sh script in plugins/gtk to be run after Glade has
        generated its C files.
      * Did some work on the KDE interface to make it suck a bit less. It still
        segfaults, but at least it runs and it looks less ugly.
      * RGB SDL rendering works again, though in 16bpp only.
      * Made plugins/vcd/linux_cdrom_tools.c independent of any vlc structure
        so that it'll be easily put in a library. Maybe libdvdcss?
      * Fixed VCD date display.
      * Merged vout_xvideo.c, vout_x11.c and vout_common.c into xcommon.c.
      * Wrote non-Shm XVideo output.
      * Made X11 output work again. Still pretty unstable, only works for 16bpp.
      * Additional french translation in po/fr.po. Any taker for the rest?
      * Fixed a segfault in video_output.c when the allocated pictures were
        not direct buffers.
      * If $DISPLAY isn't set, don't try to run the Gtk+ interface.
      * Replaced 48x48 .xpm images with 32x32 ones to conform to Debian policy
        (Closes Debian bug #126939).
      * Removed the automatic ./configure launch when running `make all' for
        the first time.
    
    Stuff currently more broken than it ought to be:
      * The wall filter. Being fixed.
      * x11 and sdl plugins for depth != 16bpp.
      * Software YUV.
      * gvlc, gnome-vlc, kvlc shortcuts. Use --intf instead for the moment.

Author: Sam Hocevar <sam@videolan.org>
Date:   Sun Dec 30 05:38:44 2001 +0000

      * Put ErrorThread() in input_ext-dec.h because it was the same function
        in all decoders. Called it DecoderError() instead.
      * All decoders enter DecoderError() in case of error, even if they
        haven't allocated all their data. This prevents the input from getting
        stuck if a decoder has failed its initialization.
      * Namespace fixes through the decoder files.

      * Fixed a segfault at EOF in input_es.c and input_ts.c (when i_read == 0).
      * Improved error recovery and avoided memleaks in the various input plugins.
      * Fixed a deadloop inserted by someone else into input_vcd.c :-)

Author: Sam Hocevar <sam@videolan.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 19 03:50:22 2001 +0000

      * Initialize SDL before opening the SDL audio output.
      * Prevent two SDL video outputs or audio outputs to be spawned at the
        same time to avoid ugly crashes.
      * The SDL plugin now says whether we are using software or hardware YUV
        in its window title.
      * We now stop at the first ':' when looking for a module name, to easily
        pass information to the modules. Possible example: --vout sdl:software,
        implementation of such an option is left as an exercise.
      * Merged filter_bob and filter_bob422 into filter_bob. Use --filter bob
        to deinterlace 422 into 420 as well.
      * Factorized code common to most filters and the video output, optimized
        a few filters by aligning data and reading 64 bits at a time.
      * Two new absolutely useless, CPU-eating, resource-wasting, but fun
        filters: enjoy `transform', which performs flips and 90� rotations, and
        `distort', which performs animated image effects (currently only a naive
        sine wave is implemented). Usage examples:
           --filter transform:hflip
           --filter transform:vflip
           --filter transform:90
           --filter transform:180
           --filter transform:270
           --filter distort:wave

Date:   Mon Dec 17 15:59:15 2001 +0000

      * TS input: we now check that the contents of the PAT has changed
        before updating it, instead of just relying on its version number.

Date:   Mon Dec 17 05:33:56 2001 +0000

      * Pathetic attempt at a 4:2:2 renderer and deinterlacer, combining the
        most awful line dropping techniques of both BOB and 422 to 420
        downscaling. Don't worry, it should only survive for a couple of days.

Date:   Sun Dec 16 16:18:36 2001 +0000

      * Filter plugins. Not very polished (please don't look at how the dates are
        calculated!), but worth a try. Use the following flags:
         "--filter invert" for inverse video
         "--filter bob" for BOB deinterlacing
      * Fixed a potential segfault if the subtitle stream was encountered
        before the video stream.
      * Misc vout4 fixes.

        in the future though (most GNU software seems to include a local copy of
        gettext in case the operating system doesn't provide it).

      * Removed more unused code.
      * Updated config.guess and config.sub from GNU's latest versions (bozo,
        you may want to update them in vls as well).

      * Removed unused code (intf_channels.c, keystrokes.h).
      * Put common_win32.h back into common.h -- it wasn't that big and we
        should not multiply header files.
      * Added gettext support by Thomas Graf <reeler@reeler.org>, may be
        broken on other platforms but we'll only see it when I'm finished
        with vout 4 :-)
      * Fixed a segfault on exit when no fast_memcpy module was found.

      * COMPLETE CVS BREAKAGE !! The MAIN branch is going to be a playground
        for my nevrotic and destructive pulsions during the next few hours!
    
      * If you want to test vlc, please use the v0_2_92_branch branch.
    
      * Stuff currently working:
         - direct to YUV buffer decoding
         - non-ugly subtitle blending
         - XVideo and SDL video output
    
      * Stuff currently utterly broken:
         - aspect ratio
         - software rendering (ie, all other video output plugins)
    
      * Additional misc changes:
         - Renamed spu_dec to spudec and mad_adec to mad to stay coherent with
           other plugins. Also, renamed mpeg to mpeg_system.
         - Added jobi to the AUTHORS file.
         - Factored code common to vout_x11.c and vout_xvideo.c.

    * added functions in inputs to change the current program (most of
      them do nothing)
    
    All inputs should now have a pf_setprogram function. A default one is
    provided in input_programs.c.

    * Added 2 fields, p_selected_program and p_new_program, to the
      input_thread_t structure, so that we may support multi programs
      streams.
    * Modified inputs to take account of this change.
    * Modified input_clock.c so that it doesn't refer to pp_programs[0]
      any more.
    
    Now we should not refer to the first program, but to the selected
    program. Functions to change the current program are coming.

      *) Removed the mutex the vout and intf thread (were supposed to use)
         for syncronizing acces to the p_vout->p_sys structure.
         The p_vout->change_lock mutex is used for syncronization now. (and
         should make synronization work)

        #include <dvdread/...> to
        #include "..."
    
     *) Darwin doesn't have off64_t, stat64, lseek64. Added

        ....

     * Big clean-up to allow compiling every module as plugins.
     * Added bytes_swap.h to provide ntoh() and htol() on Win32. With this
         change we don't have to link winsock2 with every plugin anymore. This
         should also give us a slight speed increase.
     * Added #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN in threads.h to speed-up compilation
         on Win32.
     * Modified ac_downmix_3dn and sse so they compile with the latest gcc for
         Win32.
    
    (PS: the dvdread plugin doesn't compile yet on Win32)

commit b8ff945d3ae771d67149726021c5045fda7a6adf
Author: Stéphane Borel <stef@videolan.org>
Date:   Sun Nov 25 05:04:38 2001 +0000

    Support for libdvdread.
    
    Libdvdread files are in extras/libdvdread. They have not been changed from
    those of libdvdread 0.9.2. The changes are in the subdirectory videolan.
    They basically consist of a new function in the API that does a readv()
    instead fo a read().
    
    The library is statically linked with libdvdcss from extras/libdvdcss, and
    the whole is statically linked with the plugin dvdread. Dvdread can only be
    compiled as a builtin module for the time being, I think (which means I
    haven't tried to compile it as a plugin).
    
    Basically, input_dvdread.c is a copy and paste from input_dvd.c with a few
    changes to use libdvdread calls. It is still in very alpha stage, but it
    should offer the same features as the current DVD input.
    
    It can be called with either the syntax: "dvdread:/dev/dvd"
    or "--input dvdread /dev/dvd". The command line switches (-t, -T, -c, -u)
    should work too.

    Major rewrite of the network layer. The following syntax ARE NO LONGER
    SUPPORTED :
    ts:toto:1234/meuh
    --server toto --broadcast meuh --port 1234
    
    The only supported syntax is :
    udp[stream]:[//][serveraddr:[serverport]][@[bindaddr][:bindport]]
    example : udpstream:toto@meuh:toto
    
    In most cases, simply passing "udpstream:" should work, since it enables
    unicast and broadcast reception on port 1234 from any server. Other
    options are only used for fine tuning and multicast.
    
    TODO :
    * The GTK interface is broken (glade knowledge wanted !)
    * Test this on all supported platforms (and fix them :)
    [this won't work with current channel servers - fix needed]

    -fixed a bug in libdvdcss: the key wasn't searched when it had to.
    
    dvdcss_seek : searches a new title key when
            -the flag is DVDCSS_SEEK_KEY,
            -the flag is DVDCSS_SEEK_MPEG, only if method is not "title".
    
    dvdcss_seek with DVDCSS_SEEK_KEY flags does actually the same things as
    dvdcss_title (which might eventually be removed).
    
    Thus, the flag DVDCSS_SEEK_KEY (formerly DVDCSS_SEEK_INI) could not be
    removed (sorry sam, I've mistaken you by forgetting that)

    * --chennels puts gtk/gnome in multi-channel network mode.
    
    * the network window of the interface reports the values of the environment
     variables.
    
    * channels mode excludes vls configuration
    
    * the vlc does not try to bind vls.via.ecp.fr by default when you select
     channels mode.

    Removed my modification, it seems the libs we're linking with are far
    too old to support this option. And it also seems it doesn't function
    anywhere out of my box :)

    The default file-translation mode was not being set under win32.
    In other words, file playback in 0.2.91 does not work. For de-
    scheduling threads use a 0ms sleep instead of 1ms, as it was
    causing problems under WinXP. I hope this does not introduce
    problems under previous windows versions. I noticed it was
    originally 0ms, but later changed to 1ms...

    0.2.80 no longer worked with newer version of vlc. They should work again

    Added VCD input plugin for Linux :
    
    The Linux specific stuff is located in linux_cdrom_tools files.
    For the time being, it only has title (tracks). Chapters will come if I
    ever can read .vcd files.
    I've modified Gnome and GTK+, not the others.
    I've noticed a big bug, it segfaults at the end of a title. I will
    have a look on this tomorrow.
    Please be indulgent, it's my first peace of code ;-)

    Reverted one change from my previous commit: when using title cracking
    method in libdvdcss, the key is only checked at title start, not before each
    chapter.
    
    The behaviour when we have decrypted the disc key is to check the key before
    each seek (although I'm still fighting against a bug).

Author: Stéphane Borel <stef@videolan.org>
Date:   Sat Oct 13 15:34:21 2001 +0000

    New features for libdvdcss: we have three ways now to decode a title key.
    
    1) Crack the title key (the method that was here before). The only change
    here is that we search the key for the exact chapter we are seeking with
    DVDSetArea (in case the key has changed within a title). It is maybe not a
    good idea.
    
    2) Crack the disc key, which allows us to decode instantly all title keys.
    I've used an algorithm from Frank Stevenson ; it eats much memory (64MB),
    and takes about 15 s at launch time.
    
    3) Decode the disc key with player keys (libcss method). However, you need
    licensed player keys at build time for that to work.
    
    To choose between libdvdcss methods, a command line options is supplied:
    
            vlc --dvdcss <method> where method is one of title, disc, key.
    
    Note that all these changes only work with linux now, since we have to add a
    specific ioctl to read title key. I hope that I haven't broken too many things.

    This afternoon I have been a little bored, so the feature of the day is :
    * HTTP input support.
    
    You can test it with :
    ./vlc http://mysite.com:80/mystream.mpg
    It doesn't implement any kind of buffering, so make sure you have enough
    bandwidth, otherwise you'll just get nothing.
    
    It is compatible with HTTP proxy, just set http_proxy :
    export http_proxy="http://proxy.mycompany.com:3128/"

    - fixed the "Dual Prime Arithmetic" bug ;

    they're understandable by a normal human being, and they pollute the output.

      * Fixed a bug in the gtk interface which caused vlc to go amok after
        having met a zero-sized area.
      * Found out how to type '�' in vim :-)
      * Added missing bloat to modules_export.h.
      * 'snapshot*' rules do not depend on 'clean', and don't use /tmp anymore.
      * Added vlc:loop playlist command to go back at the beginning.
        Usage: vlc file1.mpeg file2.mpeg ... fileN.mpeg vlc:loop
        This change isn't very elegant but there are already bugs in the
        playlist handling, I'll try to polish it once the playlist is fixed.

      * Added a dummy libdvdcss so that the DVD plugin can be used without
        libdvdcss. It will try to dlopen() libdvdcss at runtime, though,
        and will use the dummy functions only if it couldn't find a valid
        libdvdcss. This is probably only useful to package maintainers.
    
      * Tidied the snapshot-* Makefile rules.
      * Tidied the modules Makefiles.
      * Removed useless stuff in the debian/ directory.
      * Removed the "make all" kludge in the Makefile.opts rule. I hope this
        patch is harmless on all systems.

    * Big rewrite of the DirectX audio plugin. The audio output is now (almost)
        perfect on Win32.
    * Fixed a bug in ac3dec_CreateThread() in ac3_decoder_thread.
    * On Win32, open() will now open files in binary mode by default.

    * Fixed a segfault in yuv_End() in video_yuvmmx.c
    * Fixed the "Gdk-ERROR **: BadCursor" bug in the x11 and xvideo plugins
    * Fixed a segfault in SetBufferPicture() in video_output.c. This segfault
        only happened with the xvideo plugin because this one is not using
        SetBuffers().
    
    PS: The last fix broke the overlay output of SDL (black screen) I will
      investigate this later on.

    * Fixed a segfault in PSEnd in input_ps.c
    * The video decoder thread is now also reniced to a lower priority on
      Win32 (as in the linux version). This slightly increases the responsiveness of vlc.

    * Fixed a Win32 bug in libdvdcss. This bug was appearing on title change.
    * Modified input_dvd so you can now go directly to the selected chapter
      when you change the title.
    * Implemented the Probe function in the Xvideo plugin. Xvideo is now the
      default video output plugin when it is supported.

      * Updated version numbers for imminent release.
      * Fixed the --with-dvdcss flag:
         o --with-dvdcss - build libdvdcss, link statically (also default behaviour)
         o --with-dvdcss=local-static - build libdvdcss, link statically
         o --with-dvdcss=local-shared - build libdvdcss, link dynamically
         o --with-dvdcss=/foo/bar - don't build libdvdcss, use libdvdcss in /foo/bar
      * Fixed an omission in the dvdcss.h header.

      * Changed libdvdcss API to force binary incompatibility. Yeah, this is
        evil, but if we don't do it now we'll have to do it when more people
        are using it.
      * Fixed minor libdvdcss stuff such as the soname and compilation flags.
      * New --with-dvdcss flag.
        Explanation:
         o default: build libdvdcss, statically link vlc against it.
         o --with-dvdcss=no: build libdvdcss, dynamically link vlc against it.
         o --with-dvdcss=yes: don't build libdvdcss, use already installed one.
         o --with-dvdcss=/foo: don't build libdvdcss, use libdvdcss from /foo/*.
        (this looks a bit strange to me, I'll find better flag settings)

     * dvdcss_readv optimisations for Win32. We now send only one read command
       to the DVD drive for the whole iovec.
     * Fixed _win32_dvdcss_aread to work around the WinASPI32 64kb transfer
       size restriction.
     * New and theoretically better Win32 pthread implementation which fixes a
       problem I was having when changing title on a DVD (netlist related).
       vlc_cond_multicast may or may not work.
     * Fixed the "quit" event handling in directx/vout_events.c.
     * dvd_ifo.c now takes into account error messages from UDFFindFile.
     * Temporarily disabled aout_Probe() in aout_SDL (this function
       is creating an awful lot of problems - libSDL bug ).

    Quick and ugly hack in the makefile to allow vlc_win32 to compile when
    getting it directly from the CVS. As a result, the vlc_win32 program
    doesn't have an icon any more. Too bad.

    the scroll bar are now correct for MPEG-2 streams. There is probably a
    better way to do it, but I haven't found in months.

    - Fixed 2 Win32 bugs in libdvdcss (in _win32_dvdcss_readv), one of them
        should have prevented the Win9x dvd input from working.
    - Moved the "if(Win2k)" out of the loop in _win32_dvdcss_readv.
    
    - Put a readv() function in input_iovec.h, the input_es now compiles.
    - Modified input_ts to use this function.
    
    - Fixed an initialisation bug in vout_directx.c
    - Right clicking on the mouse now displays the navigation menu.
    
    
    PS: If someone is willing to test the DVD input on Win95/98/Me I will
        upload an up to date binary package.

    DirectX plugin changes:
    - The Win32 GetMessage function has been isolated in a thread. This has
        been done because this function can block the thread. Thanks to this
        change, you can now move your window without any video and audio
        interruption.
    - Splitted the events handling code into a separate file.
    - Fixed the bug associated with the window dragging option in the
        diplay properties.

      * libdvdcss enhancements by Billy Biggs <vektor@dumbterm.net>. This breaks
        vlc's DVD input (looks like decoders are expecting data too early and
        DVD input can't cope with it due to decryption). Needs to be investigated.
      * Plugins are now compiled in plugins/* and libraries in lib/*.
      * The KDE UI compiles again but does not work yet.
      * ALSA plugin message corrections.
      * Calculation modules can now be calledwith a shorter name
        (eg. '--downmix mmx' instead of '--downmix downmixmmx').
      * Fixed insane verbosity of the SDL plugin.

Date:   Tue Jul 10 06:07:53 2001 +0000

    - Fixed the segfault in vout_UnloadFont
    - DestroyThread in video_output doesn't call pf_destroy if pf_create has
        failed previously.
    - The Xvideo plugin now closes the video window when it XVideoGetPort
        fails in vout_Create.

    * Alignement in asm functions
    * 16 bytes alignement for data (need fo SSE)
    * Optimization in SSE

    Win32 changes only:
    
     - defined off_t as a long long. This allows DVD navigation to work.
       This change is to be implemented on a compiler by compiler basis. For
       now, it works on mingw32 (tested) and should work on MSVC (not tested).
    
     - Implemented a quick and dirty hack in intf_msg.c to be able to display
       long long integers with printf on Win32. This change is also necessary
       to avoid segfaults when debug is enabled in vlc on Win32.
    
     - few minor changes in the directx plugins.
    
     - defined snprintf in common.h and removed a few #ifdef WIN32

Author: Gildas Bazin <gbazin@videolan.org>
Date:   Sat Jul 7 21:10:58 2001 +0000

    - Removed unecessary translations in the win32 code from block offsets to
        byte offsets. This was overflowing some variables.
    - Reduced the complexity of the Win9x ASPI functions because we only need
        to handle DVD drive access.
    - Win32 code now handles seeking in areas above 2.1 Go on DVDs.

      * Small optimization in vpar_blocks.c, sparing a few memset() calls.
      * Additional error checking in vout_sdl.c.
      * Minor manpage fix, conforming to Debian policy version 3.5.5.0
        (Closes Debian bug #99561).

Author: Gildas Bazin <gbazin@videolan.org>
Date:   Sun Jul 1 08:49:09 2001 +0000

    - Portablility fix: We now control the name to be used in the assembler
        code for a C function or variable.
        GCC for Win32 normally prepends an underscore to the name of a
        C function or variable, and the inline assembler code was using the
        name without the underscore so we had undefined symbols in some
        modules.
    - Reenabled all the accelerated modules on Win32.

Date:   Thu Jun 28 22:12:04 2001 +0000

    - a few bug fixes for the directx plugin.
    - removed the custom usleep function for win32 as we don't really need
        this accuracy, and it was eating cpu resources.

    video streams at the moment.

Author: Gildas Bazin <gbazin@videolan.org>
Date:   Wed Jun 27 06:29:59 2001 +0000

    - Added command line option '--stdout <filename>' which redirects stdout
        and stderr to the specified file. This option should mainly be useful
        on Win32.
    - On Win32, vlc now has an icon associated to the .exe file, and is a full
        GUI application (you don't have this annoying dos command box anymore)
    - Added INSTALL-win32.txt for specific details to the Win32 port.
    
    I've tested these changes on Win32 and Linux, let's hope I didn't break
      vlc for other platforms.

      * Added gprof profiling support with --enable-profiling.
    
        It works at last! configure with --enable-profiling, build, run
     vlc (you may want to add --noaudio, it currently segfaults with sound
     here) and launch "gprof vlc" when finished.
    
        To make gprof work with multithreaded programs, one needs to set the
     internal ITIMER_PROF timer for each new thread launched. I did this
     through a wrapper in vlc_thread_create (see include/threads.h).

      * Merged dvdcss_init and dvdcss_open into dvdcss_open, and dvdcss_close
        and dvdcss_end into dvdcss_close. libdvdcss API now has 7 functions.
      * Another failed attempt at profiling vlc under Linux: ported the
        threads API to GNU Pth. Activate with --enable-pth. It doesn't seem to
        spawn new threads for me, maybe someone will have better luck.
      * Makefile optimizations.
      * Automatic build of libdvdcss if not found.

    *send escape packet when changing title, not to be stuck in some
    decoder.
    
    *the position in the title is now resetted when we change title to
    prevent a title from being unavailable because we're stuck at the end
    
    *fixed a bug with 1-chapter-long title that displayed chapter 0.
    
    *added a _temporary_ field in p_main to know whether the audio stream is
    ac3 (ugly). It allows a vlc launched in spdif mode to play mpeg or lpcm
    audio.
    
    *cleaned the title property messages to get rid of the ugly stars.

      * Applied old FreeBSD patch for dvd input by German Tischler.
      * Found what was causing the slowdowns: a namespace collision. Put all
        plugins into builtins again.

commit 214396bc9f2f8fb89f7241e13168b22602ff0fef
Author: Sam Hocevar <sam@videolan.org>
Date:   Thu Jun 7 01:10:33 2001 +0000

      * Put most builtins in plugins again due to performances issues (more
        about this in a forthcoming post here).
      * Fixed the painfully slow build process (at last!).
      * Moved the null plugin together with the dummy one.
      * Added new dummy input plugin.
    
       More on the dummy input plugin: we'll use it to insert commands in
      the playlist. Currently implemented are the "quit" and "pause" functions,
      here are examples on how they are used:
    
        vlc file.mpeg vlc:quit                # exit after file.mpeg has been read.
    
        vlc file1.mpeg vlc:pause:3 file2.mpeg # pause 3 seconds before playing
                                              # the next file.
    
       From now we can more efficiently benchmark vlc. For instance, to test
      the video output changes I am doing, I use such a command:
    
        time vlc -I dummy --noaudio file.mpeg vlc:quit
    
       Future extentions might include more interesting stuff like "switch
      to full screen", "repeat next file 3 times", "switch to SDL video
      output"...

               o Completely untested. I didn't manage to compile it yet.
               o Code in vout_directx.c will go through a big rewrite when
                 vout 4 is finished. Xav is already working on this.

      * Fixed the BeOS compile typo.
      * The ALSA plugin is back.
      * A gift for Gildas: plugins don't rely on backlinking any more. The
        drawback is the dirty magic in include/modules_export.h which has to
        be included whenever a module needs one of the functions in it. But
         a) we should less and less rely on those functions
         b) no plugin code modification was needed
    
       The BeOS and MacOS X modules may be broken when compiled as plugins,
       I'll check this later when I can reboot under BeOS.

      * Added a wrapper for readv() on platforms which don't support it. The
        network support now compiles under Win32, but still doesn't work, the
        select in plugins/mpeg/input_ts.c never returns any data.
    
        Is there anything like strace(1) under Win32 to debug this ?

    Modified in order to add network input under Win32.
    It compiles under Linux and Win32 (yeeaaahaaa, haven't broken anything
    :-))
    (added the WinSock library initialization and cleanup)
    Could someone test if it does really function ?

Date:   Fri May 25 04:23:37 2001 +0000

      OS X fixes:
    
      * Applied Eugenio's fix to the DVDioctl driver. I didn't test it, but
        it should not hang the kernel anymore.
    
      * Ported most dvd_ioctl.c functions to the DVDioctl driver: ReportAgid,
        ReportChallenge, ReportKey1, ReportASF, InvalidateAgid, SendChallenge,
        SendKey2. They should comply with the "Mt. Fuji Commands for Multimedia
        Devices" paper.
    
        Last remaining problem: ReadCopyright and ReadKey. The version of
     Darwin I have here only has reportKey() and sendKey() functions in
     the IODVDBlockStorageDevice class (pages 413 and 449 of the Mt. Fuji
     paper), but we also need the READ_STRUCTURE (page 357) which I couldn't
     find anywhere in the kernel headers. Either I missed it, or we'll have
     to wait for Apple to implement it (or maybe we can emulate this command
     with some other IOKit commands).

    both interfaces.

    *More cleanification in gtk interface: now to change the
    title/chapter/audio/spu/angle, we tell the input to do intead of doing
    it inside the interface. It results in fewer locks during the changes.
    
    *The dvd plugin reads again blocks of 32 sectors to gain speed since
    there are no more lock-ups during stream change. I've also created a new
    file that contain function to described video and audio streams with ifo
    datas.
    
    The changes are made only for gtk. We should update the other interfaces
    soon (beos at least).
    
    There is a memory corruption somewhere that make the vlc crash. I've no
    idea where to search.

    *initialization bugfixes in input_dvd
    
    *added a b_stopped flag to interface playlist to have a stop function in
    interface plugins. As a consequence, the playlist no longer loops on end
    but wait for the user to press 'play' or to add another item (gtk/gnome
    interface). I think that other plugins are broken but it shouldn't be
    difficult to repair: just add a 'p_main->p_playlist->b_stopped = 0' in
    play functions and 'p_main->p_playlist->b_stopped = 1' when you have to
    stop.
    
    *Updated gtk interface so that it has the same features as gnome. I
    think I will merge the code so that we don't have to copy and paste each
    change. Only the .glade file would be different.

Date:   Sun May 6 18:32:30 2001 +0000

    *Much work on the gnome interface: added oct's playlist from gtk plugin,
    tuned appearence, added preferences window (with no features yet), jump
    window to go to specified time (not functionnal yet), and fixed some
    bugs.
    
    *moved b_fullscreen from p_vout->p_sys to p_vout and unified way of
    toggling fullscreen in sdl in x11/xvideo output (using p_vout->i_ch
    nges) so that an interface plugin can toogle fullscreen (implemented
    in gnome)
    
    *added p_input->stream.p_selected_area->i_tell in input TS so that the
    slider work with ts files ( however, the time counter doesn't since we
    have no mux_rate )
    
    *improved ac3 spdif output ( and made it work again :)). It uses a true
    blank frame now, and it allows to switch languages like a traditionnal
    output. It doesn't support multiplexing though, neither can we switch
    between spdif/analogical mode on-the-fly.
    
    *beginning of the back port of gnome to gtk for those who do not have
    gnome.

      * Removed all MMX code from the main program and moved it to the

      * Mandatory step for video output IV and the audio output quality
        fix: the output threads are now spawned when a decoder needs one,
        so it can decide the audio frequency or the video window size. Still
        under heavy construction, so don't get too excited at finding bugs
        in it yet.
    
        Note: this change broke the XVideo module, so I made its score much
        lower than before. I suspect xvideo.so had a bug before which only
        appears now. Other video output plugins may be broken as well, but
        again this might be due to old existing bugs showing their ugly head.
    
      * Fixed a few buffer overflows in the Gnome interface.
      * The module bank is now a global variable. The video output bank and
        the audio output bank might follow (when they exist).
      * Coding style and organization fixes to the spdif decoder.
      * autoconf and Makefile changes by Arnaud Gomes-do-Vale

    Such a thing is necessary for dvd playback at cell change ; however,

Date:   Sun Apr 29 02:48:51 2001 +0000

    -new audio output using direct ac3 pass-through with some sound
    cards: it sends raw ac3 frames to an external ac3 decoder. It is very
    experimental yet, hasn't any synchro ... but it works well with my
    sblive and my dtt3500 speakers (note that you need a patched emu10k1
    driver for this to work).
    
    -bug fix in gnome intf thanks to Shane Harper.
    
    -bug fix in input_dvd for chapter change.

      * Miscellaneous QNX compile fixes.
      * Beginning of the mingw32 port by Gildas Bazin <gbazin@netcourrier.com>.
      * Added Marcari and Gildas to the AUTHORS file.
    
      (I commited the mingw32 port because it doesn't add any new code outside
       the #ifdefs, but we won't tell a word about it for the moment. We don't
       really need windows users whining about bugs, do we ?)

    done inside a #ifdef DEBUG
    
    It still segfaults for me on exit.

    Change --enable-debug into --enable-trace. Same with DEBUG_*.
    --enable-debug still exists, but only activates -g and additional
    safety checks.
    
    I hope I didn't break anything :))

    Repaired broadcast support : binding INADDR_ANY doesn't seem to work.
    
    You now have to specify the broadcast address as an argument.
    Btw, thanks to sam, you can now use ts://server:port style, which gives
    for broadcast :
    
    vlc --broadcast broadcast_addr ts://server[:port]

         vlc ts://vls.via.ecp.fr:1234
         vlc ts://vls.via.ecp.fr
         vlc ts:vls
         vlc ts:vls:4321

    -corrected some bugs in gnome interface: language menu are now
    synchronized ; and menus have less chances to be changed when they're opened.
    
    -added basic angle support ; this is a first try. It works with my 2
    test-DVDs, but I'd like that people having DVDs with repeated scenes to
    test it. We can choose angle with command line option -u (don't ask me
    why :)
    
    -a cosmetic change in css decryption.
    
    Since config.h.in has changed, you have to re-run ./configure.

    Re-added the new packet allocation method in PS input, using packet caches.
    With warning level 1, you can see when a packet is allocated or freed; the
    goal is to never call 'malloc' nor 'free', except at the beginning of the
    stream.
    The size of the different caches can be adjusted in plugins/mpeg/input_ps.h.
    If 'free' is called too often, it means that a cache is too small, so try
    to increase its size.

      * Updated TODO list with Henri's Apr 6th post.
      * Built-in modules support almost finished.
    
        Now you can compile any module within vlc, even the Gnome, Qt, SDL
      and GGI modules at the same time, resulting in an awful extra fat
      vlc binary with gazillons of library dependecies.
    
        The only exception is that the Gnome and Gtk+ modules can't be
      compiled together into vlc. But you can have one compiled built-in
      and the other as a plugin.
    
        Another consequence is that libdl should no longer be needed under
      MacOS X. I'll check this as soon as possible.

      * A few Makefile fixes for BeOS
      * XVideo patches by Shane Harper

commit 6b3c854071c43c099f55c5c61731e59999239854
Author: Sam Hocevar <sam@videolan.org>
Date:   Sun Apr 15 04:19:58 2001 +0000

      * Beginning of the built-in modules support.
    
       A few words about the changes:
    
      - heavy Makefile butchery has taken place, each plugin now has its own
        Makefile. I know recursive make blablah harmful, but it was just so
        much easier to do this way.
    
      - Makefile.in has disappeared, we now generate Makefile.opts with
        the overall configuration options, and Makefile.modules which is
        specific to module compilation.
    
      - After ./configure has been run you may want to modify Makefile.opts
        to check which modules will be compiled built-in or as plugins.
    
      - Some modules cannot be compiled built-in right now because proper
        linkage doesn't work yet. We don't really care since they're the
        interface or video output modules. The most important stuff works
        (iDCT, motion, YUV, input).
    
      - It's perfectly valid to compile a module both as built-in and as a
        plugin. vlc will only load the built-in one, but I'll add an option
        to ignore built-in modules for testing purposes.
    
      - We *should* see a performance increase here. I didn't have much time
        to test it, but if anyone can confirm and perhaps give a rough
        estimate of how much we gain...

Author: Eugenio Jarosiewicz <ej@videolan.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 11 13:30:30 2001 +0000

    Updated & cleaned up intf_macosx.c and vout_macosx.c - added Open menu
    function support and a no-frills About box
    
    Created macosx_common.h in plugins/macosx/ to hold , well, common stuff
    (the way I see it, there is inherently a difficult separation of intf and
    vout on Mac OS, if anyone has suggestions I'm open)
    
    Cleaned up debug spew I left in modules.c and video_text.c
    
    Hacked main.c to disregard argv[1] when compiled for OSX & run as a full
    app (ie., double clicked and not launched from command line)... read the
    file for more details.  UGLY.
    
    Updated Makefile.in to make vlc.app by default on Mac OS X & Darwin, added
    clean code for it as well

      * Removed deprecated stuff from config.h.
      * Disabled message queue by default.
      * A few other changes in the CSS code, the BeOS issues should be fixed.

    -Fall back to one-packet-once reading in dvd input since multi-block
    seems to have a bug that make the vlc crash on title/audio/spu change. I
    hope that this bug will be fixed soon for the performance is poorer now
    
    -add-ons and changes in gnome interface:
            *menu subdivision is done only if there are over 20 items,
            *in DVD mode next/prev apply to title,
            *in DVD mode, added a box with button to navigate through
             chapters.
    This has not been finished yet (and it is not in gtk plugin then). And I
    think I will leave toolbar next/prev buttons for playlist and add
    button specifically for title change like for chapters.*

     * heavy butchering in the CSS and DVD ioctl code to put all architecture-
       dependent code in dvd_ioctl.c
    
     * added almost fully-functional /dev/dvd driver for MacOS X in
       extras/DVDioctl; to build it:
    
        % cd extras/DVDioctl
        % pbxbuild
        % kextload build/DVDioctl.kext # note: kextload has to be run as root
    
       be aware that the license for the DVDioctl kernel extension is
       not GPL but APSL, because I borrowed some code from the Darwin kernel.

    being done as it has to be.
    -Fixed a bug in title management that make dvd like Seven work.

    -Changed seek function to prevent jump-at-will and to remove two bugs in
    sector computing.
    
    -Initialize some values in netlist (payload_discard wasn't which caused
    frame dropping)
    
    -Come back of multi-sector read which should make reading faster
    
    Now, theyre should be very few reading error, and we have got back the
    performance we had before my netlist polioting :p

       * SDL fixes and enhancements by Shane Harper <shanegh@optusnet.com.au>
    
       Shane, I removed the static variables from your code because static
       is not thread-safe, and one can imagine having several video output
       windows launched at the same time. Also, I made your feature work
       in windowed mode as well, because people kept asking how to hide the
       mouse pointer.
    
       Also, if you want to work on the XVideo extension, you are welcome ;
       most of us are quite busy at the moment. Damien Lucas <nitrox@via.ecp.fr>
       had offered to work on it, but he seems to be a bit lost, so you may
       want to take over his job.
    
       As for the "zoom" feature, I suggest you wait until version 4 of the
       video output is done, it'll be easier to do then.

    Some rather boring changes to keep the CVS tree up to date with my (working) build

    * Borrowed config.guess and config.sub from SDL [MacOS X port] ;
    * Changed files so that the MacOS X port compiles & runs [MacOS X port] ;
    * If SDL/GTK/DSP is not available, don't compile the associated module.

    Maybe solved the jump-at-will bug after random seek.

commit a0c1805bd992c0ae1fa018156358d831fbaf8f93
Author: Sam Hocevar <sam@videolan.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 15 01:42:20 2001 +0000

      * Bug fixes and enhancements in the Gtk+/Gnome interfaces.
    
       o the slider should behave correctly and stop jumping here and
         there (this bug is _not_ related to Stef's similar bug)
       o added an "open network" menu (useless since the input doesn't
         handle it properly yet)
       o tried to reorganize gnome_callbacks.c and gtk_callbacks.c
       o stream date is now displayed instead of percentage
       o renamed gnome_sys.h to intf_gnome.h, and gtk_sys.h to intf_gtk.h
    
      * Changed documentation and package creation files.
    
       o added versioned conflicts/replaces to vlc-gtk (Closes Debian bug #88796)
       o removed useless or outdated documentation from doc/*
       o moved vlc.1 manpage from debian/vlc.1 to doc/vlc.1
    
      * Added basic Qt interface.
    
       o working features: slide bar, open file, toolbar, popup menu
       o added "qvlc" alias, equivalent to "vlc -I qt"
       o known issues : no "open disc" or "open network" menus yet
                        the IntfWindow class is never cleaned on destruction
                        the popup menu always pop at the middle of the screen
    
      * Misc fixes/updates.
    
       o renamed netutils.h functions from input_* to network_*
       o renamed *plst* files and functions to *playlist* (it was stupid
         from me to name them "plst")
       o made a few input error messages more meaningful
       o added -I, -A and -V short flags, corresponding to --intf, --audio
         and --video
    
        I got a lot of conflicts on this commit, lart me if I forgot a
      file or made old bugs reappear.

    Port of the interface menus to gnome plugin.
    
    Note that two sorts of navigation menus are implemented : in the
    menubar, one menu for title and one the chapter in current title ; and
    in the popup, a cascaded version with all chapters for all menus.
    
    The same issues as gtk plugin apply.

    -Working menus for run-time audio/spu/title/chapter selection with gtk
    interface.
    
    It is a bit buggy yet, and some pieces of code need to change,
    especially to handle better menus change when title change but it
    eventually works.

      * Disabled network input under BeOS so that it compiles again. We'll
        have to wait for BONE anyway.

Author: Henri Fallon <henri@videolan.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 7 00:18:46 2001 +0000

    - Fixed TS input ( a nasty dead lock had appeared 4 days ago )
    - Added base of network support
    
    Things to be done :
    - Meuuh : fix the PCR synchronisation so that we can set b_pace_cntrol to 0
    - Sam : find a way of specifing the type of media (file, net). For the
    moment, the "--input ts" always call input_NetworkOpen
    - Maybe sam : for the moment the working syntax is vlc --input ts
    servername, it should nbe turned into "vlc --server servername".
    
    Things that don't work (i'll work on this this week end) :
    - stopping and retaking a stream
    - a nice 'waiting for stream'
    - we select all incoming streams. we should be able to select.
    
    Things that haven't been tested :
    - broadcast
    - only tested with one stream.
    
    Kick me if something is broken by my fault.

    -Fixed bugs in title/chapter handling once more, especially for size
    detection and location of main movie.
    
    -Support for multitrack DVD : now the stream is given to input as it has
    to be ; however, all the tracks are displayed one after the other ; I
    think we need to decode navigation ES to choose the track
    
    -Fixed behaviour at end of device.

Author: Stéphane Borel <stef@videolan.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 2 03:32:46 2001 +0000

    -New function for DVD reading, that is able to read multiple blocks
    (I've chosen 32 now), that doesn't use any memcpy anymore and is also much
    faster. It is ready now for cell positioning in multi-angle DVD (to come
    soon).
    
    -DVD specific netlist adapted to 2048 bytes long blocks that contain
    several data_packets.
    
    -Modification in mpeg_system.c to use p_payload_start instead of
    p_buffer (necessary for DVD plugin). It does not break other plugins
    since they set p_payload_start to p_buffer
    
    -New field i_read_once in input_thread_s to be able to read more than
    the TS related 7 packets ; i_read_once is set to INPUT_READ_ONCE by
    defaults but plugins can change it during initialisation.
    
    Please check that nothing is broken :)

      * The GGI video output should now be faster. Also, right-mouse-clicking
        works in GGI mode as well.

      * Optimizations done to the SPU decoder. Now the RLE is expanded at
        decoding time, not rendering time. The main loop in vout_RenderSPU
        is now 20 lines long.

      * The Gtk+ interface is now built as a Debian package as well. The Gnome
        package depends on it because of the icon and menu entry.
      * Added an intf_WarnHexDump() function to do raw hexadecimal dumps of
        memory areas. For debugging purposes or for real men, as you wish.
      * Lots of tidying in dvd_ioctl.c, a few comments added.
      * Better error handling in the subpicture decoder.
      * Tidied video_spu.c. More to come later.
      * Fixed subtitle displaying. Will soon work in overlay mode as well.

    -New ES detection based on .ifo for DVD module. It might fail (I have
    found one DVD for which ifo seems false).
    
    -Title and chapter selection on the command line (see -t and -T options)
    It will allow to watch some DVD that went through menus by default.
    
    -beginning of menus in gnome interface.

    Some changes in the BeOS video output :

      BDirectWindow (better performances)
    - Added resizing
    - Added beta support for overlay

      (note: empty CVS mails mean that a new directory has been created,
       don't forget to use the -p option if you cvs update)
    
      * Added a plain Gtk+ port of the Gnome interface, for the gnome-impaired
        people. Gtk+ is now compiled by default, while Gnome isn't (you will
        have to add --enable-gnome when running configure)
      * Replaced -lcurses with -lncurses in configure.in.

    TS Input :
    - Added DemuxPSI, DecodePAT and DecodePMT. Never tested which streams
      where PAT or PMT are splitted in more than one section.
    - Some TS files still don't work (matrix.ts i.e : no sound ),
      others do ... i'll have to investigate.
    
    Todo :
    - What if data get unaligned ?
    - Write NetworkOpen
    - Try to find why I get no sound on matrix.ts
    - Support Stream and program selection.

      * Ported Glide and MGA plugins to the new module API. MGA never worked,
        so this didn't make it work better.
      * Started thinking about built-in modules, and added some code to
        make it easier eventually.
      * Added Oct in the AUTHORS file.
      * Fixed a mistake in configure.in.
      * All your base are belong to us.
      * Fixed a bug in src/misc/modules which prevented loading modules
        when launched from the Tracker.
      * Fixed a similar bug in src/video_output/video_text.c.
      * BeOS CSS support, thanks to Markus Kuespert <ltlBeBoy@beosmail.com>
        who ported the Linux DVD ioctls. We can now read encrypted DVDs

     First serie of changes in DVD module for the forthcoming interface menus
     There is a new capability in input type modules for setting the
    attributes of a new area. It is set to NULL for PS and TS plugins.
     It should be called for every title change, chapter change,
    audio mode change or spu channel change.
    
    But this part of code is not used at the moment, and is not completed
    yet.

    -Change in the code to detect beginning of movie. It is much better now
    but still fails with some DVD for which the movie is not the first
    Program.
    
    As a consequence some DVD that worked before don't work anymore.
    
    -Beginning of ideas to handle chapters and ES selection

        support for $(bindir) $(datadir) and $(libdir) stuff, courtesy
        of Arkadiusz Miskiewicz <misiek@pld.ORG.PL>
      * Ported ggi.so to the new modules API. As for the other modules, only
        the "q" key works. Moreover, VLC doesn't exit cleanly if you close the
        GGI window.
      * Deactivated non-working widgets in the Gnome interface.
      * Added CONTRIBUTORS file.

       The BeOS port seems to work again.
    
       I used this command to play an unencrypted DVD, but maybe there is a
       better solution: ./vlc dvd:/dev/disk/ide/atapi/1/master/0/raw
    
       Current problems: gcc doesn't like MMX-EXT instructions, and refuses
       to have register %ebx being used in the main application. Grr.

    -UDF filesystem support so that we know the location of the first video
    related file with 100% reliability (great change that should make DVDs
    with binaries and extra stuff work with vlc).
    
    -Correction of a bug in ifo reading that falsified the adress of
    video titles.
    
    -Changed the method for selecting title at start. It is _not_ reliable
    though, but it is better than the preceding one.

     * Tried to fix the BeOS interface and video output. Any BeOS developers
       listening ? I can't even test that code, it probably wants additional
       fixing.
     * Added a workaround in modules.c for broken libc's which happen to truncate
       filenames in dentry structures when using 64bits offsets. The kind of
       stuff you only see in RedHats <g>.
     * Made the SDL error messages a bit more useful.
     * The Gnome menu is now created when mouse is released, not when it
       is pressed. It may sound stupid, but it really makes a difference.

     * Upgraded version number to 0.2.61. Release is today.
    
     * Fixed package building (both RPMs and .debs).
     * Fixed `make snapshot' rule.
     * Added some magic to filename detection. To read a DVD you now just
       need to run 'vlc dvd:/dev/hdc' for instance. Same for file:// URIs.
     * Fixed a segfault in the slider when no stream was playing.
     * Made the slider go from 0 to 100 (instead of 99 :)
     * The vlc now doesn't exit when finished playing. As a side effect of
       the playlist code being very recent, it continuously loops.

     * Fixed a segfault in the input thread creation, as well as a possible
       deadlock. This happened mostly when opening non-existing files.
     * Created input_SetStatus to do input_SetRate's job. input_SetRate will
       be used to set an arbitrary rate, for people who want to read DVDs at
       1/2.71828 times the actual speed.
     * Stubs for the ncurses control interface. No working code yet, but the
       holes just need to be filled.
     * Improved X11 support. Still not as functional as before.
     * The output window now states the method name, so that people know whether
       they are using X11 or SDL.
     * The Gnome interface is now drag'n'drop aware, you can drop a file
       on it just like Xine does (or so I guess).

    -Changes in the way stream size in DVD mode is calculated. It is no
    longer such an ugly kludge and is much more accurate.
    
    -Changes in DVDSeek so that the interface slider is in 0 when we are at
    the beginning of the strem.
    
    -Try to detect the beginning of the movie in the middle of the title. It
    works for most of the DVDs but will begin in the middle of the movie
    with some others.
    
    -Calculate only the first title key in css mode because it might take a
    long time with some title. The search stops now when we have a key once
    whereas it did stop only when we had it twice before. It should not
    cause problems.

    -adaptation of DVD module to navigation slider. The seek has to be
    done on a multiple of 2048, and shopuld take care of the offset to the
    beginning of the stream. It works with most of my DVDs by fails to
    detect size of some streams.
    
    -change of the order of call to ifo and css functions in input_dvd.c,
    because we can't read ifo files before authentification on some DVDs.
    
    -changed location of some css tables.
    
    -we read ifo date and decrypt css keys for all titles now. It takes quite a
    long time to initialize with some DVDs (if you have 42 titles for
    instance). The key decryption might give a false value if the title is
    less than 10 Mb ; I'm working on that :)

      know the video decoder well enough to do it myself.

     * added --intf option to vlc
     * started cleaning vout_sdl.c
     * the dummy plugin works again
     * added a slider to the Gnome interface so that we can browse through streams
    
      There is a problem with the slider: we sometimes get unexpected async
      replies, which would mean that we don't properly lock our Xlib calls.
      Which is true. But we also get these errors when using `--vout dummy'.
      I'll investigate.

      * Fixed my old stupid bug that disabled sound after having played the
        first playlist item.
      * Added `Prev' and `Next' buttons to the interface, with the beginning of
        a playlist window (still empty).
      * Added `Slow' and `Fast' buttons to the interface and popup menu.
    
      Ok, I promise it's the last time I check bloat in, from now the interface
      commits will be much cleaner and actually fix things :)

     * The pure Gnome part of the Gnome interface has been rewritten from
       scratch, and the .glade file included as well. You can edit it by
       installing glade-gnome and doing `glade plugins/gnome/intf_gnome.glade',
       or directly by hand if you grok XML.
     * Files can now be loaded into vlc using the `Open' buttons. But for the
       moment you still have to launch vlc with at least one file, because it
       quits when the end of the playlist is reached.
     * Idle screen was disabled because it eats a lot of CPU and is mostly
       useless for the moment. And it gets activated when pause lasts for too
       long.

      Beginning of Interface II
     ---------------------------
    
     * Plugins have completely disappeared, we now only use the new module API.
     * All intf and vout modules are now independant. So far, only the Gnome
       intf module and the SDL vout module have been ported. configure.in has
       been modified to reflect the changes (x11 and dummy aren't compiled by
       default anymore, while SDL and Gnome are).
    
      Note that this is _not_ Interface II, it's just a step forward. For
      instance, it lacks the whole message passing scheme.
    
      Things that should work:
    
     * Right-clicking on the SDL video output window brings the Gnome menu.
     * Pause, Play, Exit, About work from the menu or from the interface window.
     * The old SDL keys still work.
    
       Things that are broken or may be broken:
    
     * Xlib calls are not locked yet, which may lead to "Unexpected async reply"
       errors, and make the vlc segfault.
     * Sound only works for the first file.
     * The SDL vout_sdl.c file is absolutely ugly and kludgey.
     * The vlc immediately quits when no filename is given as an argument. Not
       a real bug, but still annoying.
     * The Gnome menu does not work in fullscreen mode.
    
       Things that will come soon, maybe tomorrow:
    
     * Complete navigation buttons (fast forward, slow, etc.).
     * File/Open menu to add files to the playlist.
     * Return of the X11 video output for those of us who do not have SDL.
     * Textmode interface for those of us who do not have Gnome.
     * aout and vout autospawn (maybe).

       This commit is a bit early, but it'll save Stef, Henri and me much
     time later, when we don't have to backport modifications to input_*.c
    
       What's new :
        - playlist works again (still the old wrong way like Meuuh doesn't
        like, but this is going to change within a few hours)
        - input_ps, input_ts and input_dvd are now plugins, located in
        plugins/mpeg/ and plugins/dvd/
    
       What's broken :
        - audio output might be broken on some streams ; have to investigate
    
       What has changed :
        - fast/slow keys are now A/Z instead of A/S since S was already
        linked to the scale/noscale toggle.
        - `--dvd' doesn't work anymore, for the moment try to use :
         vlc --input dvd /dev/dvd
        - module bank is now less verbose ; use `--warn 1' to turn back
        verbosity on

    -New method using netlist to read packets on DVD device by sectors of
    2048 bytes.
    -Some modifications in netlist to make it work with DVD.
    -Fixed � bug in mpeg_system.c
    
    We use INPUT_READ_ONCE many times in the input code. I think that
    we should replace it with a field in input_thread_t to give more
    flexibility to modules. I have done it in DVD plugin but it can't work
    if input.c is limited by INPUT_READ_ONCE.
    
    The DVD method is slower than input_ps ; but there are things to
    improve.
    CSS descrambling is broken.

     . version 0.2.50 for the Linux Expo
     . --overlay and --fulscreen options (only work with --vout sdl)
     . the vlc exits after the end of the stream, which prevents from having
       to kill it and relaunch it during a presentation, just script it like :
    
          for i in ~/mpeg/* ; do vlc --fullscreen --overlay --vout sdl $i ; done
    
    
     Yes, I know the --overlay stuff is fucking ugly. But *I* am not the one
      who redefines vout_sys_t in an interface-related source file. I won't
      change it until the vout/intf is finished being rewritten.
    
     Additional information: if "--overlay --fulscreen" doesn't center your
      picture, try with your screen geometry, eg:
      "--overlay --fullscreen --width 1024 --height 768"

        The motion compensation routines are now modules as well ; choose your
      implementation with `--motion motion', `--motion motionmmx' or
      `--motion motionmmxext'. Of course, the best implementation is chosen
      if you don't ask for any. There doesn't seem to be any performance hit
      due to the move to shared libs, which is a good thing. Please test
      actively if you have time, though.
    
        Updated --help result, manpage, INSTALL document, and a few files.
    
        I moved vdec_motion.h and vpar_blocks.h back to /include because they
      will be needed to build motion compensation modules, but perhaps we don't
      need to export everything which is in these files.
    
        /src/video_decoder/ now has only one .c file, perhaps it could now be
      merged with video_parser ?

    - Added SDL sound support. Sounds a bit laggy sometimes but my streams are ill.
      please try.
    - modified configure.in and all that stuff. Re-run configure
    - SDL audio, video and interface are all part of the same .so now.
    - remove YUV old files :->

    * Borrowed livid's latest libmmx and MMXEXT MC. Not in the Makefile => to
    test it, replace vdec_motion_inner_mmx.c by vdec_motion_inner_mmxext.c.
    
    I'm interested in performance feedback.

     . a few changes in the CPU extensions detection code, borrowed from the
       kernel and from mpeg2dec. I still don't know how to detect if code
       compiled with -mcpu=pentiumpro will run, since the cpuid arcanes are
       quite obtuse to me. Perhaps we should also have a way not to load modules
       if they have been compiled with a different CPU to avoid segfaults.

       need to touch plugins/idct/idct_mmxext.c (ok, the filenames suck).

     [ include/config.h.in has changed, don't forget tu run ./configure ]
    
     . fixed the --aout, --idct and --yuv flags
     . updated manpage and --(long)help output to reflect that change
     . removed a few unneeded #includes here and there
     . cosmetic changes in error messages in input.c
    
       Currently available flags are now :
    
         --aout dummy
                esd
                dsp
                alsa

         --yuv yuv
               yuvmmx
    
      --vout works like before, but still uses the old plugin system for now.

    . Now use of 64 bits offsets to parse the whole DVD. So we have all the
    available information
    . Fixed a bug in parsing of VTS attributes
    . Fixed a bug in input.c that made input plugin initialize even though
    no stream is reachable (thanks Sam)
    
    I hope I'll be able to get the position of the movie soon.
    
    Meuuh : the seek function of the plugin now take off_t as argument which
    could be a problem later. Maybe it should take off64_t or time argument.

     . merged the YUV plugins in the same directory to avoid too much code
       duplication
     . YUV transformations now use the new module API ; now only the vout
       and interface still depend on the old plugin API
     . changed TestMMX to TestCPU because we will be able to test for other
       specific extensions (3DNow, SSE) for the forthcoming IDCT we'll
       borrow to mpeg2dec (as usual :P)
     . don't show "hiding module" messages anymore except in debug mode
     . swapped C IDCT and Classic IDCT scores since the classic one seems
       to be faster ; anyway you should use the MMX one
     . fixed a Makefile bug under BeOS
     . tried to fix the cpuid code so that it compiles under BeOS (Polux, can
       you test it when you have time ?)

     . fixed the bug-that-made-the-vlc-segfault-on-exit, which means that
       more than ever, � le client ne segfaulte pas �.
    
     . there was still a problem upon quitting: sometimes the null packet
       wasn't big enough to reach a decoder breakpoint, so I now create 10
       of them (since I can't make it bigger) to be sure. Meuuh, what do
       you think ?
    
     . fixed the Makefile to spare a few variables here and there.
    
     . reduced module hide delay, removed loading of the audio output
       plugins since they are now modules.
    
     . changed a few intf_Msg to intf_DbgMsg, and added "vout:", "intf:",
       and so on in a few other messages.
    
     . removed unused includes in the idct modules.

    . Correction of bugs in ifo parsing. Now the structures should be well
    initialized. It remains some segfaults but it globally works.
    . DVD mode is enabled with option --dvd. For the moment, it only read
    the first vts and find the movie if it is at the beginning of the title
    set.
    
    Coming soon:
    . udf filesystem management to access over 2Gb zones.
    . detection of the offset to the movie inside a vts when it is not at
    the beginning.
    
    Is there a chance that using fopen/fseek function instead of open/lseek
    system calls solve the 2Gb issue ?

     . the IDCT functions are now located in modules : the classic IDCT,
       our optimized IDCT, and MMX IDCT.
     . cosmetic changes for modules (pf_* instead of p_*)
     . fixes to the BeOS and dummy modules
    
       WARNING: a new directory has been added, which means you have to
       use `cvs update -dP' to update ; files have been removed , which means
       you either have to run `make distclean' or remove the .deps directory,
       and the configure script has changed, which means you have to run it
       again. Don't complain before having checked this :)
    
       Note about the IDCT modules: there is no way to choose the one we
       use, but you may remove the module in lib/ to prevent it from being
       loaded. The preference order is : MMX, Optimized, Classic.

    * Moved decoder_fifo-specific code from programs.c to dec.c ;
    * Fixed bugs in program.c that prevented vlc to close all decoders ;
    * Gave sam a lesson for the use of the bitstream in spu_decoder.c :ppp ;
    * Made the video parser unlock the reference pictures before quitting
    (still one left, yaknow why ?)

      . moved the MPEG audio decoder to the new bitstream
    
        I wasn't sure whether the bits counting method was effective to
      skip ancillary data at the end of a frame, but I kept it for
      safety. There is still a lot to optimize in the bit counting, like
      unrolling the first iteration of some loops, but I don't know if
      it would be worth it. The other solution would have been to look for
      a startcode after eache frame, without caring about the ancillary bits.
    
      . cleaning in the SPU decoder.

     . moved swab32 from input_ext-dec.h to common.h. We probably won't need
       it anymore really soon, since ntohl() and htonl() seem to be properly
       optimized when gcc is passed the right optimization flags.
    
     . fixed GetBits32 and RemoveBits32. I know the #ifdefs are useless since
       we only support u32 words, but it's a safe reminder. Comments appreciated
       on this fix since I may have b0rked something -- it runs well here though.

     . separated MODULE_CONFIG_START and ADD_WINDOW (Henri, beware)
     . fixed a very, very old bug that caused namespace collision between
       plugins (Henri, beware: call your aout_getplugin function like this,
       not alsa_aout_getplugin)
     . removed the Debian specific clean rules from the Makefile, since they
       are already handled by the debian/rules script.
     . tidied a few compilation rules (-lfoo should always be at the end)

       possible problems
     . Added a missing #ifdef in intf_msg.c which prevented compilation
       with --enable-debug
     . Fixed a bug in the input that prevented to quit properly in certain
       cases (some ES were not deleted because their index was skipped when
       the former one was deleted, well Meuuh should know what I mean)
    
      There is still a segfault when quitting, most presumably in the
     audio output. I couldn't find what causes it yet.

     . all plugins now compile with -fPIC.
    
     . made the audio_output API a bit simpler.
    
     . got rid of modules_config.h.
    
     . fixed `make install' rule.
    
     . fixed warnings in the MMX YUV compilation.
    
     . probably fixed a bug in the input : pp_foo structures were free()d at
       the end, but this was useless since the last call to realloc() is
       equivalent to free(), and two consecutive calls to free() aren't a
       goo idea.
    
     . we check that the version number match and that we don't already have
       a module by that name when loading a new module.
    
     . all public module_* functions now properly lock the module bank.
    
     . the audio_output now uses the new module API ; EsounD and DSP modules
       have been ported, which should be enough for Henri to port the ALSA one.
    
    
       The new plugin API is now much simpler ; it's now just a matter of
    calling module_Need( p_main->p_module_bank, MODULE_CAPABILITY_FOO, p_data );
    and if successful we get the best module. Capabilities can be ORed, so that
    one can ask for a plugin that does VOUT _and_ INTF actions for instance.
    
       It's not complete yet though -- by making it generic I had to do a few
    ugly casts here and there, which I am going to fix ASAP. Also, command line
    selection of a plugin does not work yet.
    
       The switch to the new plugin API has probably broken the BeOS audio
    output ; we can either wait until the whole vlc has switched to the new
    plugins, or create a separate beos_sound.so that conforms to the new API.

     . should compile & run on Solaris with ./configure --disable-dsp
        (tested on puma)
     . removed most SYS_SOLARIS #ifdef's in favour of more generic tests
     . updated example ./configure line in INSTALL file
     . now we only load modules that end with ".so"
     . null module is compiled by default

    BSD port, including :
    * --enable-sdl and some others are now --with-sdl[=name] to supply an
    optional library name ;
    * deleted all unnecessary #include <sys/uio.h> ;
    * /usr/include is now searched when looking for libraries and headers.
    
    It seems to compile and run on BSD. Under Linux Sam's latest commit makes
    vlc crash on startup, so I can't really tell, but hey it compiles.

     . src/misc/modules.c is in a workable state now.
    
      To test it, run ./configure with the --enable-null flag, which will
      compile the Null Module as a plugin. Watch the memory usage at the
      launch and when the plugin is released.

     . this is a coding style patch which removes all "foo(bar){" constructions
       and most of the tabulations.
     . also, fixed a bug in the default subtitle track.
     . and made a few error messages more explicit, ie. changed "error: %s" to
       "foo error: couldn't initialize bar (%s)"
     . and removed a warning in intf_ctrl.c which isn't used anyway.

        clean compilation of the Null Module.

     . added the Null Module, the module that does nothing but that is going
        to be of great help for debugging my module code.

     . Added files needed for the forthcoming module management.
    
     Notes:
    
       Plugins are now called modules, because we will be able to compile
       them either as a dynamic plugin, or within the program. And, more
       important, I can commit this without having to break the vlc :)
    
       I tried to be as clear as possible in my comments, please tell me
       if a few prototypes still have an unclear beahaviour.
    
       Current features:
        . none, files haven't even been added to the Makefile yet.
    
       Future features:
        . dynamic loading (done)
        . built-in modules (still to do)
        . automatic unloading of plugins (done)
        . dynamic configuration (still to do)
        . automatic choosing of the most appropriate plugin for a given
           task (still to do but well prepared)

    grrrr, I'll kill someone) ;
    * Put config.h in front of others in audio_decoder.c.
