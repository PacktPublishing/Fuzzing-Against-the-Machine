INSTALL file for the VLC media player
=====================================

More extensive information for *nix, Windows and Mac OS X users can be
found here: http://wiki.videolan.org/Compile_VLC

People installing VLC for Windows from source MUST read:
http://wiki.videolan.org/Win32Compile

Bootstrapping VLC
=================

If you retrieved VLC from the git server and do not have yet a "configure"
script, please run:

    ./bootstrap

Configuring VLC
===============

A typical way to configure VLC is:

   ./configure

See `./configure --help' for more information.

If you intend to debug stuff, you may want to compile with debugging
symbols:

   make distclean ; ./configure --enable-debug

We recommend using GCC to build VLC, though some people reported success
with the Intel C compiler (version 8) as well. GCC version 4.8 or higher is
required. On older systems (e.g. FreeBSD 4.x), please select a more recent
version manually by setting the CC and CXX environment variables
appropriately while running the ./configure shell script.


Building VLC
============

Once configured, run `make' to build VLC.


Installing and running VLC
==========================

You can install the VLC and its plugins by typing:

   make install

But you don't need to install it if you don't want to; VLC can be launched
from the current directory as well:

   ./vlc


Building packages
=================

To build a Debian package, you need to get the packaging info
   git clone git://git.debian.org/pkg-multimedia/vlc.git debian
and then
   git-buildpackage
