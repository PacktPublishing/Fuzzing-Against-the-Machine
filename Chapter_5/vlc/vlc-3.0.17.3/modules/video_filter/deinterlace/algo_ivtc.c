    /* This algorithm is based on detecting hard-repeated fields (by motion
       detection), and conservatively estimating what the seen repeats could
       mean for the cadence position.

       "Conservative" means that we do not rule out possibilities if repeats
       are *not* seen, but only *add* possibilities based on what repeats
       *are* seen. This is important. Otherwise full-frame repeats in the
       original film (8fps or 12fps animation is very common in anime),
       causing spurious field repeats, would mess up the detection.
       With this strategy, spurious repeats will only slow down the lock-on,
       and will not break an existing lock-on once acquired.

       Several possibilities are kept open until the sequence gives enough
       information to make a unique detection. When the sequence becomes
       inconsistent (e.g. bad cut), the detector resets itself.

       The main ideas taken from the TVTime/Xine algorithm are:
        1) Conservatively using information from detected field repeats,
        2) Cadence counting the earlier detection results and combining with
           the new detection result, and
        3) The observation that video TFF/BFF uniquely determines TFD.

       The main differences are
        1) Different motion detection (see EstimateNumBlocksWithMotion()).
           Vektor's original estimates the average top/bottom field diff
           over the last 3 frames, while ours uses a block-based approach
           for diffing and just compares the field diffs between "curr" and
           "next" against each other (see IVTCLowLevelDetect()).
           Both approaches are adaptive, but in a different way.
        2) The specific detection logic used is a bit different (see both
           codes for details; the original is in xine-lib, function
           determine_pulldown_offset_short_history_new() in pulldown.c;
           ours is obviously given below). I think the one given here
           is a bit simpler.

       Note that we don't have to worry about getting a detection in all cases.
       It's enough if we work reliably, say, 99% of the time, and the other 1%
       of the time just admit that we don't know the cadence position.
       (This mostly happens after a bad cut, when the new scene has
       "difficult" motion characteristics, such as repeated film frames.)
       Our frame composer is built to handle also cases where we have no
       reliable detection of the cadence position; see IVTCOutputOrDropFrame().
       More important is to never lock on incorrectly, as this would both
       generate interlacing artifacts where none existed, and cause motion
       to stutter (because duplicate frames would be shown and unique ones
       dropped).

       nb_fields = 3,2,3,2,... and *video* TFF = true, false, false, true
       (TFF telecine) or false, true, true, false (BFF telecine).

       We don't particularly care which field goes first, because in soft TC
       we're working with progressive frames. And in any case, the video FDs
       of successive frames must match any field repeats in order for field
       renderers (such as traditional DVD player + CRT TV) to work correctly.
       Thus the video TFF/BFF flag provides no additional useful information
       for us on top of checking nb_fields.

       The only thing to *do* to soft telecine in an IVTC filter is to even
       out the outgoing PTS diffs to 2.5 fields each, so that we get
       a steady 24fps output. Thus, we can do this processing even if it turns
       out that we saw a lone field repeat (which are also sometimes used,
       such as in the Silent Mobius OP and in Sol Bianca). We can be aggressive
       and don't need to care about false positives - as long as we are equally
       aggressive about dropping out of soft telecine mode the moment a "2" is
       followed by another "2" and not a "3" as in soft TC.

       Finally, we conclude that the one-frame future buffer is enough for us
       to make soft TC decisions just in time for rendering the frame in the
       "current" position. The flag patterns given below constitute proof
       of this property.

       Soft telecine is relatively rare at least in anime, but it exists;
       e.g. Angel Links OP, Silent Mobius, and Stellvia of the Universe have
       sequences that are soft telecined. Stellvia, especially, alternates
       between soft and hard telecine all the time.
