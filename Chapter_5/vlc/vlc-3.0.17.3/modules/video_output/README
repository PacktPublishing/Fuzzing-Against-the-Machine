Video output display plugins
=============================

Priority rules
---------------

The priorities ranges are as follows since December 2014:

 - less than  20: console (text)
 - less than  50: plain frame buffers
 - less than 100: no embedded windowing
 - less than 150: SW scaling
 - less than 200: SW chroma conversion
 - less than 250: SW subpicture blending
 - rest: good stuff :-)

No more than one plugin with a given non-zero riority.

On Windows, native outputs are now priorized over XCB (as there now is
a Win32 port of XCB).
