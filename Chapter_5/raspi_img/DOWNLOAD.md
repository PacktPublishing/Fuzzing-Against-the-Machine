set your QEMU image to run the native vlc on ARM Linux for raspi here

replace the kernel image with the bullseye one https://github.com/dhruvvyas90/qemu-rpi-kernel/blob/master/kernel-qemu-5.10.63-bullseye
it is pretty handy to set it up. Create a local directory and have a specific QEMU install for that.
If you have a raspi device, just install bullseye on it. And go ahead.
