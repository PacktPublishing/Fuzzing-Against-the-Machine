# Fuzzing-Against-the-Machine 2023

## This is the official repository of the book edited by Packt Publishing and Authored by Antonio Nappa and Eduardo Blazquez Gonzalez

### The first chapters do not have practical exercises besides some code excerpt
### Expect to stress your network connection because the images we prepared with all the ready-to-fuzz components are quite big

Links are coming soon.
