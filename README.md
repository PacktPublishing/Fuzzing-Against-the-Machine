## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
#include <stdio.h> 

int main() { 
     printf("Hello, qemu fans!\n"); return 0; 
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for security researchers, security professionals, embedded firmware engineers, and embedded software professionals. Learners interested in emulation, as well as software engineers interested in vulnerability research and exploitation, software testing, and embedded software development will also find it useful. The book assumes basic knowledge of programming (C and Python); operating systems (Linux and macOS); and the use of Linux shell, compilation, and debugging.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
